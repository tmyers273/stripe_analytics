# Auth TODOs

- [ ] Design non-email organization invite flow (placeholder: manual member addition API) and integrate once outbound email is available.
- [ ] Replace logging email stub with real provider adapter and transactional templates when provider is selected.
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting around Redis-backed auth rate limits.
- [ ] Implement Google/Facebook/Apple OAuth providers once credentials are provisioned.
